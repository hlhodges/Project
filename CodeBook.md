The data set contained in tidy_data.txt is derived from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0. The latter consists of movement recognition variables for 30 human subjects as they engaged in 6 different classes of physical activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING) as estimated via accelerometer and 3-axial gyroscope signals generated by the Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn by each. 70% of the subjectsâ€™ data was classed as training data, and 30% was classed as test data. tidy_data.txt provides averages of the mean and standard deviation estimates per subject per activity type, excluding the following estimates calculated on the angle() variable:

* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

tidy_data.txt begins with the Subject and Activity columns, which consist of the subject ID number and the activity type performed by each, respectively. The data columns consists of two groups of averages (Test and Train) of the following variables for each of the 30 subjects, listed by activity type:

* tBodyAcc-mean()-X
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
* tBodyAcc-std()-X
* tBodyAcc-std()-Y
* tBodyAcc-std()-Z
* tGravityAcc-mean()-X
* tGravityAcc-mean()-Y
* tGravityAcc-mean()-Z
* tGravityAcc-std()-X
* tGravityAcc-std()-Y
* tGravityAcc-std()-Z
* tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X
* tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y
* tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z
